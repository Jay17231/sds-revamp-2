					<p class="gap-20">SDS started in 1994 specializing in technology support and contract programming. In late 90s, in reaction to industry trends, the Company decided to <strong class="color-red">seek higher value-added engagements, particularly client/server solutions and strategic IT consulting services</strong>. In connection with this initiative, the Company began to focus on providing its clients with specialized IT services on a time & materials and fixed bid basis. Since then, we have been recognized as preferred vendor to Fortune 1000 companies. We have successfully pursued projects in <strong class="color-red">Information Technology, Telecommunication, Wireless, Banking and Pharmaceutical industries</strong>.</p>
					
					<p class="gap-20">SDS, an E-verify Employer & a Minority Woman owned Small Business Enterprise (MBE/WBE/SBE), is committed to providing <strong class="color-red">quality IT consulting solutions, systems integration and outsourcing services</strong>. SDS’s mission is to provide customers in industry and government with solutions crafted to meet their strategic goals and enable them to profit from the advanced use of technology. SDS considers itself a leader in providing IT services through <strong class="color-red">“Project Staffing Division”</strong> by hiring and staffing its organization with experienced and accomplished employees and consultants.</p>
					
					<p>Most often, consultants are used primarily for staff supplementation to partake in development work to meet the needs of customers. More clients are now looking to fully outsource development projects, as well as complete software systems support and maintenance including legacy systems. We, at SDS, understand this trend in consultant utilization and believe our <strong class="color-red">“Project Solutions Division”</strong> to be the answer. Our goal is to <strong class="color-red">leverage our employees to provide quality staffing and cost-effective outsourcing</strong>. We have invested in experience proven leadership, process development and facilities to support our initiative.
