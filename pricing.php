						<div class="accordion-content" style="display: none;">
						<p><strong>Dynamic experiments</strong></p>
						<p>No problem has a single solution and no single solution can solve all the problems. We understand that RPO solutions are an on-going chain of tasks driven towards transitioning custom RPO solutions quickly and painlessly. The dynamic mechanism of our RPO model allows us to scale up or down quickly, as needs evolve.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Cross-team co-ordination</strong></p>
						<p>We understand the need for organizations to draw the line while adopting RPO solutions. We could take on the entire hiring process for a segment while the corporate team takes on addressing other company needs. Or, we could work with the client’s talent acquisition team on fulfilling hiring needs.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Challenging problems delivered with a solution</strong></p>
						<p>Often the need for outsourcing is to address positions which are considered hard-to-fill. While your organization is being faced with requirements which require you to step outside your comfort zone, our RPO solutions give you the opportunity to shift your liability without having to stretch your wings.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Experienced talent acquisition specialists</strong></p>
						<p>Experience is a master of its own. Our RPO solutions nurture the right talent mix of experienced individuals who are distributed between the requirements which are volume based and those which require specialists.</p>

						<div class="accordion-content" style="display: none;"><p><strong>One cannot get ahead anywhere without a plan.</strong></p>
						<p>A planned contingent workforce in an organization provides for significant scalability for adjusting to the changing needs of the business in the number of workers within the company with relative ease. And that too without increasing the existing head count of permanent employees. At SDS we understand these challenges and help our clients to convert them to competitive advantages.</p>
						
						<p><strong>What makes us stand apart?</strong></p>
						<p>We are an independent global IT company and we don’t sell a particular technology. This impartiality allows us to expand our services to manage every aspect of contingent workforces needs within an organization. This includes program design, consulting, vendor selection, worker sourcing, compliance tracking and management, interview logistics, offer management, assignment management, on and off-boarding, extension management, timesheet or timecard management, vendor and worker payments, and the production of management information and spend analysis.</p>
						
						<p><strong>From local to global</strong></p>
						<p>The hot-button issue of the moment is how to manage contingent workforce populations on a multi-regional or global basis. There are no two countries that treat contingent workers in the same way; the rights of non-permanent employees vary greatly and are even more complex when contingent workers employed in one country and deployed to another. Our global infrastructure and holistic approach to talent and resourcing means that we are uniquely positioned to advice on this issue.</p>
